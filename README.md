# Setup Instructions for Python Environment with Libraries

## Requirements
- Python
- Anaconda
- pip
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps to Set Up Environment

### 1. Install Anaconda
If you don't have Anaconda installed, download and install it from the official Anaconda website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).


### 2. Install Required Libraries

#### Install OpenCV
To install the `opencv-python` library, which includes the core OpenCV, use the following pip command:

pip install opencv-python

#### Install OpenCV (with Contrib modules)
To install the `opencv-contrib-python` library, which includes both the core OpenCV and extra modules, use the following pip command:

pip install opencv-contrib-python


#### Install MediaPipe
To install `mediapipe`, run:

pip install mediapipe


### 4. Install Jupyter Notebook
To use Jupyter Notebook, install it with:

pip install notebook


### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Once everything is installed, launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

jupyter notebook

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can start writing your Python code in notebooks.


## P.S. Restart kernel in case of 'module not found' or 'no attribute' errors if all libraries are installed properly. Create necessary folders per your structure.
